<!-- directions -->
<div class="container whitebck reveal">
    <div class="content" id="directions">

        <h2>How to get there</h2>

        <p class="text reveal">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-train"></i> Travelling by train is our favourite way to move around Europe (and the one we endorse the most!). <br>
            If you plan to travel before or after the wedding, or you plan to travel during the day, we strongly suggest an <a href="https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/global-pass">Interrail plan</a>, but check what train lines are covered first. <br>
            By train, find a connection to Torino Porta Susa or Torino Porta Nuova. There are a few trains a day on the Paris-Lyon-Torino line (not covered by Interrail passes), or you can pass by Milano Centrale. Starting June 2026, there should be a new night train serving the Amsterdam/Brussels-Koln-Berne-Milan line (partially covered by Interrail passes). <br>
            Once in Torino, there are various trains from Porta Susa and Porta Nuova to Saluzzo (with change in Savigliano or Cuneo).
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> The closest major airports are Caselle (Torino) and Malpensa (Milano), with frequent connections to the respective cities. There is a smaller airport near Costigliole Saluzzo (Levaldigi, Cuneo), but it serves <a href="https://cuneoairport.com/destinazioni/">few destinations</a>. <br>If you plan a trip on the Costa Ligure or Cote d'Azur, you can also consider Cristoforo Colombo (Genova) or Nice Cote d'Azur. <br>All these airports are connected to Saluzzo via public transport, or are ~3h or less away by car.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-bus"></i> There are a few busses from Saluzzo to Costigliole Saluzzo, namely #91 and #115 from the Bus Company (that's the name, no joke) and #2 from Arenaways.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            <i class="fa-solid fa-car"></i> You will be able to rent a car in every major airport, but it will be less expensive to rent in Turin (~1h away) or Milan (~2h30' away), with a few options available in Saluzzo (~15') and Cuneo (~30') as well. <br>
            Closer to the wedding, we will add all guests to a <i class="fa-brands fa-whatsapp"></i> group to self-organise car trips.
        </p>

<!-- stay -->
<div class="container greybck reveal">

        <h2>Where to stay</h2>

        <div class="leftofimg reveal">

            <p class="text reveal">
                There are not many places to stay in Costigliole Saluzzo. We suggest to stay in Saluzzo instead, where you will find various hotels, BnBs, and AirBnBs for every pocket.
            </p>
            <p class="text reveal">
                A few suggested places are Perpoin, in the city centre, Antiche Mura and San Giovanni Resort (former convent, next to a church), in the upper old town, Agriturismo Camisassi and Antico Podere Propano, on the outskirt of the town - but there are plenty of other valid options.
            </p>
            <p class="text reveal">
                Booking directly through their websites (or a quick search on Google maps) may save some bucks compared to aggregators (e.g. Booking.com).
            </p>
            <p class="text reveal">
                The small towns between Saluzzo and Costigliole Saluzzo (Manta and Verzuolo) offer a few hotels and AirBnBs as well. For a bigger town, look up Cuneo.
            </p>

<!-- dresscode -->

    <div class="content" id="dresscode">

        <h2>Dress code</h2>

        <p class="text reveal">
            The main thing is that we want you to feel comfortable during the day, so wear what makes <i>you</i> happy. However, since we are with guests from many different cultures and expectations, here some guidelines to keep in mind.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            For people who would like to wear a dress, please no white, cream, red, or black ones. For non-Italians: typically the dresses in Italy are a bit more elegant, e.g., long evening dresses. Garden dresses are also great.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            For anybody who would prefer to wear pants and a shirt/blouse (overhemd in Dutch), please no shorts or flipflops, long sleeves are appreciated. Suit jackets and ties are also appreciated - they are typically worn at weddings in Italy, but we don't require them.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            If you have traditional cultural wedding attire, feel free to wear that instead!
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            If you need inspiration, look up attire from garden party, smart-casual, semi-formal, up to formal.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            Kids can wear whatever they want. They are free spirits.
        </p>

<!-- travel -->
<div class="container greybck reveal">
    <div class="content" id="travel">

        <h2>Travel around</h2>

        <p class="text reveal">
            Close to the wedding day, we will create to a <i class="fa-brands fa-whatsapp"></i> group, in which we'll let you know if we're doing something (and where we'll be) the day before and after the wedding. You can join us, if you want, in the chillest vibes possible.
        </p>

        <p class="text reveal">
            Since most of our guests will travel to Italy, we encourage to make a holiday out of it! <br>
            For a weekend holiday, consider Saluzzo and its surroundings. At the convergence of three mountain valleys, Saluzzo has a rich history, starting with the era of the Marchesato (1142-1548), and narrated in its musea, as well as cozy restaurants, and a vibrant, although townish, night life.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            If you fancy a few days in the mountains, Val Po, Val Maira, and Val Varaita will offer you plenty of options for walks, hikes, climbs, kayaking, and other outdoor activities.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            For gastronomic visits, the surroundings offer plenty of options already, but a little further away Alba and Asti will be able to satisfy your needs for wines, cheeses, and chocolate.
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            Don't overlook Turin, the first capital of Italy: this city, as beautiful as often overlooked by tourists, offers plenty of musea (including one of the biggest Egyptian musea in Europe), walks, palaces, and plenty of great restaurants. On the way there, you can visit the Sacra di San Michele (Avgiliana) or the Reggia di Venaria (Venaria).
        </p>
        <p class="text reveal">
            Feel free to ask suggestions to Stefano!
